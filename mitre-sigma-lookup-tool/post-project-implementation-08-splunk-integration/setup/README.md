# Splunk Integration Setup
- This part details the setup of the Splunk integration. Note that I already have Promox installed on my Windows computer and so I was able to do everything through my Proxmox web console on my Macbook

## Download the Ubuntu Server ISO
- Go the `https://ubuntu.com/download/server` and click `Download` for the latest Ubuntu Server. For me, I downloaded Ubuntu Server 26.04 LTS

- I went to my Proxmox web console, expanded the storage node on the left, and clicked on local (`1`). I then selected the ISO Images tab in the center menu (`2`) and clicked `Upload` (`3`) and then `Select File` (`4`) to upload the Ubuntu ISO

## Create the Splunk Virtual Machine
- Click `Create VM` at the top right corner

- Once you click `Create VM`, this menu should popup. For this first one, name your VM. I choose `splunk-server-vm` for simplicity

</p>

- After you click `Next`, select your Ubuntu ISO that you downloaded. For the `System` tab after this tab, I personally skipped and left it on default because there was no change needed

</p>

- Then, set the Disk Size to 40-50 GiB. I picked 50 GB but this depends on your setup

</p>

- Set the Cores to 2 or 4 (depending on the level of computational performance on your secondary machine's CPU)

</p>

- Set the memory to 4 or 8 GB (depends on your setup and how much RAM you have). For the `Network` tab, I also skipped this one and left it on default and clicked `Finish` after this to setup the VM

</p>

## Install the Ubuntu OS
- Click on your VM (`1`) and then Console (`2`) and then click on the `Start Now` button (`3`)

</p>

</p>

- Click the default option (first option)
<p align="center">

</p>

- It will automatically grab an IP address via DHCP. Write down this IP address as we will use this later

</p>

- Click `Use an entire disk`

</p>

- Enter the below information

</p>

- Click `Install OpenSSH server` and I used this to SSH from my Macbook instead of having to use the Proxmox browser (Note that we also needed the IP address from the previous step). For the next step, just click through the optional featured snaps screen and wait for installation

</p>

- Wait until this completes and click `Reboot` when finished. Note that if Proxmox asks you to remove the installation medium, just hit enter

</p>

## Verify the Remote Connection
- Once the VM boots back up, I used my terminal on my Macbook to SSH directly into the VM and was successfully able to login
```bash
ssh username_goes_here@<VM_IP_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE>
```
