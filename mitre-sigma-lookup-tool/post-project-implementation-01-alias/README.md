## Post Project Implmentation #1: Alias
- I decided to add this improvement as the first one. Creating an alias is very helpful instead of typing out long commands in the terminal
	- To make it a standalone command, we need to give the file execute permissions. This is because Unix systems require execute permissions before a script 	  can be run directly from the terminal
 ```bash
chmod +x mitre-attack-sigma.py
```
 - Next, I opened my configuration file via `nano ~/.zshrc` and added my alias
```bash
alias mitre="~/path/to/your/folder/mitre-attack-sigma.py"
```
  Since I am in a 	virtual environment and my 		script relies on packages such as `rich` and `yaml` inside my `venv`, a standard alias 		might fail if the virtual environment isn't active.
  - I fixed this by pointing the alias 		directly to the Python interpreter inside my venv 
```bash
alias mitre="~/path/to/your/folder/venv/bin/python3"
```
- The full alias
```bash
alias mitre="~/path/to/your/folder/venv/bin/python3 ~/path/to/your/folder/mitre-attack-sigma.py"
```
  - Then, I saved it via `source ~/.zshrc` and 	tested it with `mitre Masquerading`. Below are the results and it worked. As you can see instead of having to `cd` inside folders and provide a long command, I can just type `mitre` which is the alias and it works the same way as it did before. Note that I also do not need to be inside the `venv` folder and can deactivate it and it still works
